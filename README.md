# Apache Kafka™ and Kafka Streams Workshop

The repository contains the materials (i.e. agendas, slides, code) for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) workshops led by Jacek Laskowski.

It is assumed (but yet to be proved) that the workshop may take up to 3 days.
