# Apache Kafka™ and Kafka Streams Workshop

The repository contains the materials (i.e. agendas, slides, code) for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) and [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) workshops led by Jacek Laskowski.

The current version of the workshop may take up to 3 days and is intended (but not limited) for a variety of IT roles, e.g. software developers, administrators, operators and architects.

The goal is to get you fairly comfortable with Kafka and Kafka Streams in nearly no time. After the course, you should be well-versed with Kafka with regard to administration, operation and development.

No prior experience with Apache Kafka or Kafka Streams required.
